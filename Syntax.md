Variable declaration can be done using `var = value`
A conditional can be done by adding {} after an expression with the condition(s) inside

- Equal sign inside `{}` is used for comparison
- `!` is used for negation
- Greater than and less than are represented by `>` and `<` respectively
- `>=` and `<=` are used for greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to respectively
`!` next to a number or variable (the variable should be to the right of the `!` with no spaces in between) indicates the factorial of that number or variable
Arithmetic operations are done using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^` for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation respectively
Parentheses `()` can be used to group expressions
Functions can be defined with mathematical function syntax `f(x) = expression`
Functions can have multiple variables `f(x, y) = expression`
Functions can call other functions `f(x) = g(x) + 1`
Surround an expression with || to get the absolute value of that expression
Trig functions work through the standard function name. For hyperbolic trig functions, add `h` to the end of the function name (e.g. `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`)
for inverse trig functions add `a` to the front of the function name (e.g. `asin`, `acos`, `atan`)
use ln for natural log
use log for base 10 log
use [] for an array or list or matrix
use erf for the error function
use erfc for the complementary error function
for inverse functions put ^-1 in between the function name and the parentheses (e.g. sin^-1(x))
for derivatives you can use d/dx or what ever variable or dy/dx or whatever variable
prime notation is also supported (e.g. f'(x), f''(x), f'''(x))
you can also use f[x]' to indicate the xth derivative of f
